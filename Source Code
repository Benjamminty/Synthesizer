/*SYNTHESIZER PROJECT
 * by Benjamin Miller, Mouser Electronics
 * 
 * This synthesizer should take an input from a capacative sensor and play a note associated with that sensor.
 * This is acheived by assigning that "note" to a different pin through which it will be played. When a note
 * is assigned a pin, the pin struct gets loaded with information about that pin (the current state, the index
 * and the original index so that it can be refreshed).
 * An interrupt will occur at 100kHz which will check to see if any of the pins need toggling. Each note has a certain frequency
 * at which it must be toggled.
